            <p class="text-muted text-left" >A large tourist attraction. It is one of the world wonders. This is a site made by the Incas in the 1500s to keep themeselves away from the invasive Spandiards. This historic site was never found by the spaniards, but a group of explorers in the early 1900s. To see the full view of this lost city, you must hike for 7 hours up the Machu Pichu Mountain which is at 9,000 feet in the air. Although it is 9,000 feet in the air, the hike is only 2,000 feet upwards. </p> </div>

            <p class="text-muted text-left" >The Big Island is part of a series of islands that make up the state of Hawaii. It is a great tourist attraction mainly because of the volcanoes that are there. The main volcano is called Kīlauea and is not active at the moment. It had errupted recently in September of 2021. When I visited, I walked on the surface of the volcano and took a test to become a junior ranger there. The beaches there are great and very relaxing. The visit there was great, and there were so many great activities to do. It is a nice place to visit and you will probably never get bored.</p> </div>

            <p>I saw it in the theaters recently. It was great.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun. At minimum:Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant Man and the Wasp's problem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

            <p>This movie only came out a month ago. I watched it on the first week that it released. It was a great movie because of the humor, and the animation along with live action charecters. I really enjoyed it also because it is a great time for the main charecter Sonic to help his old family, and his new one. Try to use the restroom before or else you will miss the fun.</p>

            <p>This movie came out somewhere at at beginning of the year. I watched it in the theater. It is suspensful and full of action packed mystery. There is lot of humor in the movie, and many people wanted to watch it because it had the star as "Dwayne (Rock) Johnson. The only reason why I gave the movie four stars is because there are too many villians who keep on coming back, and it just seems unreal for this to happen.</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>
